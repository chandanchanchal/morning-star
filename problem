Given:

Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. 
If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. 
So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.



Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.

Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. We need to access the parent class from inside a method of a child class.
